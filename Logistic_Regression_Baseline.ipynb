        "This notebook takes the dataset I will be using for my Unet model and makes logistic regression classifications on a pixel by pixel basis. Due to computational constraints, the model is trained on only 26000 datapoints of the millions of pixels in the dataset. This should serve as basis for comparison to future deep learning segmentation models. As evidenced, the precision and recall for classification of pixels as pineapple plantations is low."
